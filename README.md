My name is Kevin and I just started a new career in cyber security in August 2021. 
I've always had a keen interest in computers but my passion for cyber security was never realized until recently. 
I needed to make a change as I was unhappy with my career field at the time so I began studying and researching about cyber security.

I'm learning a lot of new stuff everyday and want to use this as a brain dump, essentially, for projects or things I want to keep handy and organized.
